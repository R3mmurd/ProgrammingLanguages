# Programming Languages

Source code developed in the Course Programming Language at ULA VE.

This course starts with a simple example of a Propositional Logic Language
which was adapted in C++ from the original source by [Brian Yu](https://brianyu.me/),
then it splits in studying three Programming Languages providing three different paradigms.

Form Lecture01 to Lecture06 we are consagrated to study the functional paradimg
with SML, from Lecture07 to Lecture09 we study OOP with Ruby, finally, from
Lecture10 and Lecture11 are dedicated to Concurrent Programming with Go.
